            "abstract": "This paper discusses how migration, poverty and gender-based discrimination have had an impact on HIV/AIDS vulnerability among rural women in Lesotho. It is based on data from a clinic-based HIV/AIDS prevalence study with 150 women aged 15-49 from two rural communities in Butha-Buthe and Mafeteng Districts of Lesotho, and existing legal and policy structures. It shows that existing efforts to address HIV/AIDS vulnerability among this population focus primarily on risk-taking behaviour and risk-generating situations, and largely fail to address contextual issues that create and facilitate risky behaviour and situations. The paper advocates that respecting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of individuals can reduce HIV/AIDS vulnerability and that greater emphasis must be given to the gender discrimination embedded in Basotho culture, the acute lack of access to health care and education in rural areas, and the precarious economic and social circumstances facing many migrants and their families in Lesotho."

The project also examined gender differences in the way HIV/AIDS education was perceived and the implications for the instructional design of the programs. A total of 15 high school students (eight females and seven males between the ages of 13 and 18) in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, were recruited through purposeful sampling. Data were collected using two focus groups with each group comprising one gender. This separation of genders was ideal to enable participants to express their thoughts freely and to observe possible gender divergences. Findings: All participants agreed that school-based HIV/AIDS education was essential but that unfortunately, most of the programs that students attended were neither interesting nor beneficial. Gender differences were observed with females asking for in-school AIDS education to completely modify its focus and males feeling that the education's current strategies should simply be improved. The implications of these results are discussed along with recommendations for further research."

Hearing aids should be individually tuned to satisfy the requirements of hearing impaired persons. Cosine modulated filter banks are one popular filter bank having simple design procedure with efficient implementation structure. In the proposed structure for hearing aid, non-uniform subbands are obtained using two methods. The first method is by merging the adjacent channels of a uniform filter bank and the second method, is by using transition filters between two filters with different bandwidths. The advantages of the proposed structure are simple design procedure, less implementation complexity, greater flexibility in tuning the subbands for various types of audiograms and improved performance in terms of matching error.

Researches on children's perception of risk, knowledge and support services for infected persons have been rarely undertaken. This paper is based on responses obtained from 120 in-school children aged 9-13 years drawn from three schools in the Cape Coast Metropolis of Ghana. The respondents provided qualitative data through essays and quantitative data through questionnaires. All the respondents have had some knowledge on HIV and AIDS and knew of where to access HIV and AIDS information. More than seventy per cent of them were not willing to purchase fresh vegetables from AIDS vendors nor were willing to allow AIDS infected female teachers to continue teaching them. It was recommended that children should be targeted with behavioural change communication messages especially by teachers to enable them live harmoniously with people infected and affected with AIDS.\nAu Ghana, il a �t� estim� en 2013 que quelques 34 557 enfants vivaient avec le VIH et le SIDA.

Using a cross-sectional survey design and non-probability purposive sampling method, 728 participants were surveyed. Data were collected using self-developed, validated scales for coping and caregivers' challenging experiences. Results showed no significant gender difference in coping. Employment status had a significant influence on coping, with the employed coping significantly better than the unemployed. Marital status did not significantly predict coping among caregivers. Caregivers who did not receive food support coped less well with the challenges of caregiving. Caregivers who did not perceive that they had financial challenges, challenges of meeting medical demands of relatives, or the challenge of the fear of death of relatives (respectively) were more likely to cope better with the stress of caring for people living with HIV/AIDS. Caregivers face a number of psycho-social challenges, and it is recommended that policy makers, non-government organizations and healthcare providers review their programmes to assist in addressing psycho-social challenges in this context."

This paper develops a neural network framework for combining multiple subject factors into a single model that predicts speech intelligibility and quality for a nonlinear hearing-aid processing strategy. The nonlinear processing approach used in the paper is frequency compression, which is intended to improve the audibility of high-frequency speech sounds by shifting them to lower frequency regions where listeners with high-frequency loss have better hearing thresholds. An ensemble averaging approach is used for the neural network to avoid the problems associated with overfitting. Models are developed for two subject groups, one having nearly normal hearing and the other mild-to-moderate sloping losses."

Comparative quantitative FP/HIV data was gathered during quality improvement process from database at Zambia Prevention Care and TreatmentPartnership (ZPCT) Consortium for 2012 and 2013. Qualitative data was collected using semi-structured interviews with 29professionals, at the main urban clinic in the district, from January to June 2013. Two key indicators were assessed: HIV/FPreferrals at facility level and male partners’ involvement in seeking HIV/FP services. Referrals between HIV and FP servicesduring the first semester of 2013 increased by 1.0% compared to 2012, whilst male involvement in integrated FP/HIV services remained stagnant at 11%. Low male involvement in FP/HIV service was linked to busy spouses’ work schedules(74%), and lack of knowledge (16%). FP/HIV couple counseling was offered on selected clinic days in 74%, whilst lackof policy implementation encouraging male involvement was noted in 58% of responses. Fear of FP side effects (89%), longdistances to the clinic (74%), lack of adequate health information on FP (17%) and unavailability of the preferred FP method(11%) were essential obstacles to service accessibility. Internal systems improvement indicated slight progress incross-referrals reported. Interventions on the demand side are required, such as in strengthening male involvement in FP/HIVservice. FP services in the district would also benefit from increased variety of accessible FP methods."

            "abstract": "Since many years, international tax law experts debate the relevance of changes to OECD Commentaries for the purpose of the interpretation of previously concluded tax treaties. Although, generally, most experts seem averse to the idea of an ambulatory approach to the usage of OECD Commentaries, they are reluctant to exclude this idea altogether. Such a position raises an important issue of justification: When exactly should the ambulatory approach be taken? As argued in this essay, the proper answer to this question depends on the particular rule of interpretation justifying the usage of OECD Commentaries in particular cases. If Commentaries are used according to Article 32 of the VCLT as part of the circumstances of the conclusion of a tax treaty, then because of the very nature of this means of interpretation, a static approach would have to be taken. If, instead, Commentaries are used to determine the ordinary meaning of the terms of a tax treaty, or its object and purpose; or if Commentaries are used based on Article 31, paragraph 3(b) of the VCLT; then the VCLT confers on interpreters a discretion. This discretion is limited by the principle of good faith, which means that interpreters will have to continue searching for the intention of treaty parties. Although this search can be rationalized as the application of general factors, as argued in this article, no choices between a static or an ambulatory approach can be made other than relative to particular cases, based on an overall assessment taking all applicable factors into account. Readers should contrast this conclusion with the position of many international tax law experts, who argue that such choices can be dealt with conclusively by the adoption of some or other general principle."

This study aimed to estimate, at a population level, the survival experience of Italian people with AIDS (PWA) and to quantify the prognostic role of selected factors at diagnosis in the risk of early mortality (i.e., within six months from AIDS diagnosis). Methods: A population-based, retrospective-cohort study was conducted among Italian PWA diagnosed between 1999 and 2009 and recorded in the national AIDS registry. The vital status, up to December 2010, of 14,552 PWA was ascertained through a record linkage procedure with the Italian mortality database. Survival probabilities were estimated through Kaplan-Meier method. To identify risk factors for early mortality from any cause, odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for major confounders, were computed using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Of the 5,706 deaths registered among the 14,552 PWA included in the study, 2,757 (18.9 %) occurred within six months from AIDS diagnosis. The probability of surviving six months increased from 81.2 % in PWA diagnosed in 1999-2000 to 82.9 % in 2009, while the 5-year survival augmented from 60.7 % in PWA diagnosed in 1999-2000 to 65.4 % for PWA diagnosed in 2005-2006. Elevated risks of early mortality were associated to older age (OR = 5.28; 95 % CI: 4.41-6.32 for age ≥60 vs. <35 years), injecting drug use (OR = 1.71; 95 % CI: 1.53-1.91 vs. heterosexual intercourse), and CD4 count <50 cells/mm³ at AIDS diagnosis (OR = 1.87, 95 % CI: 1.55-2.27 vs. ≥350). Elevated ORs for early mortality also emerged for PWA diagnosed with primary brain lymphoma (OR= 11.66, 95 % CI: 7.32-18.57), or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (OR = 4.21, 95 % CI: 3.37-5.27). Conclusions: Our study documented, among Italian PWA, the high -- though slightly decreasing - frequency of early mortality in the full cART era. These findings indicate the need for enduring and ameliorating preventive actions aimed at timely HIV testing among all individuals at risk for HIV infection and/or those who present diseases known to be related with HIV infection.

This study examines the causes of death among AIDS-patients in China and uses a methodology to increase data accuracy compared to the previous studies on AIDS-related mortality in China, that have taken the reported cause of death in the National HIV Registry at face-value. Methods:  Death certificates/medical records were examined and a cross-sectional survey was conducted in three provinces to verify the causes of death among AIDS patients who died between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011. Chi-square analysis was conducted to examine the categorical variables by causes of death and by ART status. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate factors associated with AIDS-related death versus non-AIDS related death. Results:  This study used a sample of 1,109 subjects. The average age at death was 44.5 years. AIDS-related deaths were significantly higher than non-AIDS and injury-related deaths. In the sample, 41.9% (465/1109) were deceased within a year of HIV diagnosis and 52.7% (584/1109) of the deceased AIDS patients were not on cART. For AIDS-related deaths (n = 798), statistically significant factors included CD4 count 3 at the time of cART initiation (AOR 1.94, 95%CI 1.24–3.05), ART naïve (AOR 1.69, 95%CI 1.09–2.61; p = 0.019) and age <39 years (AOR 2.96, 95%CI 1.77–4.96). Conclusion:  For the AIDS patients that were deceased, only those who initiated cART while at a CD4 count ≥200 cells/mm3 were less likely to die from AIDS-related causes compared to those who didn’t initiate ART at all.

Having identified a higher rates of Late HIV diagnosis, this study was aimed to determine Determinants of late diagnosis of HIV among adult HIV patients in Bahir Dar, Northern Ethiopia. Methods:  A case control study was conducted between January 2010 to December 2011 at Bahir Dar Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital. The study subjects consisted of 267 cases and 267 controls. Cases were adult people living with HIV/AIDS whose initial CD4 T cell count was 4 T cell count of greater than 200/ μl. Trained staff nurses were involved in data collection using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics and Binary logistic regression were performed. Results:  Subjects who hold a certificate and above (AOR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.13. 0.54), being initiated by friends, families and other socials to undertake HIV testing (AOR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.29, 1.48), who reported a medium and high knowledge score about HIV/AIDS and who undertake HIV testing while visiting a clinic for ANC (AOR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.83) were less likely to be diagnosed late. Subjects who undertake HIV testing due to providers’ initiation (AOR = 1.70; 95%CI = 1.08, 2.68), who reported a medium internalized stigma (AOR = 4.94; 95% CI = 3.13, 7.80) and who reported a high internalized stigma score towards HIV/AIDS (AOR = 16.64; 95% CI = 8.29, 33.4) had a high odds of being diagnosed late compared to their counterparts. Conclusion:  Internalized stigma, low knowledge level about HIV/AIDS, not to have attended formal education and failure to undertake HIV testing by own initiation were significant determinant factors associated with Late HIV diagnosis. Education about HIV/AIDS, promotion of general education, and encouraging people to motivate their social mates to undertake HIV testing are highly recommended. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

In this study, we demonstrate that the integration of biological information, namely gene expression data, can enhance the sensitivity of genetic studies to unravel new genetic associations relevant to AIDS. Methods:  We collated the biological information compiled from three databases of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) involved in cells of the immune system. We derived a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are functional in that they correlate with differential expression of genes in at least two of the databases. We tested the association of those SNPs with AIDS progression in two cohorts, GRIV and ACS. Tests on permuted phenotypes of the GRIV and ACS cohorts or on randomised sets of equivalent SNPs allowed us to assess the statistical robustness of this method and to estimate the true positive rate. Results:  Eight genes were identified with high confidence (p = 0.001, rate of true positives 75%). Some of those genes had previously been linked with HIV infection. Notably, ENTPD4 belongs to the same family as CD39, whose expression has already been associated with AIDS progression; while DNAJB12 is part of the HSP90 pathway, which is involved in the control of HIV latency. Our study also drew our attention to lesser-known functions such as mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and a zinc finger protein, ZFP57, which could be central to the effectiveness of HIV infection. Interestingly, for six out of those eight genes, down-regulation is associated with non-progression, which makes them appealing targets to develop drugs against HIV. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

            "abstract": "Summary A cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine the risk factors associated with intestinal parasitosis in HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Socio-demographic information was collected and faecal samples were analysed from 384 randomly selected patients on ART. Data on CD4+ T-cell counts and World Health Organization clinical staging were obtained from the medical records at the hospital. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51% to 61%). No opportunistic intestinal parasites or Schistosoma haematobium eggs were detected. Unavailability of latrine and lack of hand washing with soap were associated with Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.75; 95% CI: 1.77 to 4.27 and AOR, 2.67; 95% CI: 1.60 to 4.44, respectively) and Giardia lamblia (AOR, 2.08; 95% CI: 1.08 to 3.99 and AOR, 2.46; 95% CI: 1.06 to 5.75, respectively) infections. Intestinal parasitosis was significantly associated with low CD4 cell count (p = 0.002). In contrast, intestinal parasitic infections were not associated (p > 0.05) with the World Health Organization disease staging. In summary, poor personal hygiene and sanitation practice contributed to the high prevalence of intestinal parasitosis. Routine diagnosis for intestinal parasitic infections should be performed in patients attending ART clinics in this setting.\n (© The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.)"

This study sought to explore the challenges and enablers in shifting the HIV/AIDS case management services from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) to Community Health Service Centers (CHSCs) in urban China. Methods: A qualitative method based on the Health Policy Triangle (HPT) framework was employed to gain in-depth insights into four elements of the task shifting strategy. This included a review on published literature and health policy documents, 15 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 30 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with four types of key actors from three cities in China. A total of 78 studies and 17 policy files at the national, municipal and local levels were obtained and reviewed comprehensively. Three semi-structured interview guides were used to explore key actors' views on shifting the HIV/AIDS case management services to CHSCs. Results: It is necessary and feasible for CHSCs to engage in case management services for PLWHA in local communities. The increasing number of PLWHA and shortage of qualified health professionals in CDCs made shifting case management services downwards to CHSCs an urgent agenda. CHSCs' wide distribution, technical capacity, accessibility and current practice enabled them to carry out case management services for PLWHA. However our findings indicated several challenges in this task shifting process. Those challenges included lack of specific policy and stable financial support for CHSCs, inadequate manpower, relatively low capacity for health service delivery, lack of coordination among sectors, PLWHA's fear for discrimination and privacy disclosure in local communities, which may compromise the effectiveness and sustainability of those services. Conclusions: Shifting the HIV/AIDS case management services from CDCs to CHSCs is a new approach to cope with the rising number of PLWHA in China, but it should be implemented alongside with other efforts and resources such as increasing public funding, planned team building, professional training, coordination with other sectors and education on privacy protection as well as non-discrimination to make this approach more effective and sustainable. Policy makers need to ensure both political feasibility and resources accessibility to facilitate this shifting process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Current recommendations endorse the involvement of people living with HIV in the development of programmes for people living with the virus. The purpose of the study was to explore and describe the health literacy needs of women living with HIV. The research design was qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual. After women living with HIV/AIDS were sampled purposively,semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight women and qualitative content analysis done. The findings revealed that the women expressed a need to increase their knowledge about HIV/AIDS. The knowledge they needed ranged from basic pathophysiology about HIV/AIDS, to the impact of HIV/AIDS on their health, to an awareness of the modes of HIV transmission and methods of protecting others from being infected. Other important health literacy needs related to self-care and correct antiretroviral use. A need for psychosocial skills was also identified in order for women to build and maintain their relationships. Recommendations were made for nursing practice, education and further research, based on these findings.\nVroue in Sub-Sahara-Afrika word buite verhouding geraak deur die virus en vorm 60% vandie totale MIV/VIGS - infeksies in hierdie streek. Huidige aanbevelings onderskryf die betrokkenheid van mense met MIV/VIGS in die ontwikkeling van MIV/VIGS programme virmense met die siekte. Die doel van hierdie studie was om die gesondheid geletterdheid behoeftes van vroue met MIV te verken en te beskryf. Die navorsing was kwalitatief, verkennend, beskrywend en kontekstueel. Vroue met MIV/VIGS is doelgerig geidentifiseer ensemi-gestruktureerde onderhoude is met agt vroue gevoer waarna kwalitatiewe inhoud-sanalisegedoen is. Die bevindinge het getoon dat die vroue 'n behoefte het om hul kennisoor MIV/VIGS uit te brei. Die kennis wat hulle benodig wissel van basiese patofisiologie oor MIV/VIGS, die impak van MIV/VIGS op hul gesondheid, 'n bewustheid van MIV-oordrag en maniere om naasbestaandes teen besmetting te beskerm. Ander belangrike gesondheid geletterdheid behoeftes het betrekking tot self-sorg en korrekte antiretrovirale gebruik. 'n Behoefte aan psigososiale vaardighede is ook ge�entifiseer sodat vroue verhoudinge kanbehou en bou. Aanbevelings gebaseer op hierdie bevindinge is vir die verpleegpraktyk, verpleegonderwys en verdere navorsing gemaak."

We facilitated conversations in three higher education research settings through the medium of a digital animation based on a storyboard prepared in response to experiences of university educators who integrate HIV and AIDS-related issues in their teaching. We screened the digital animation and encouraged responses from the three audiences, then used these responses together with our own deliberations to explore the 'what' and 'how' of making public our work. Using digital animation for generative action, we found that the four conceptual and methodological features of generative processes (playfulness, passion, perspicacity and participation) that we identified through previous research may be extended to a fifth - that of publicising research, or 'going public', which played an important role in our innovative and responsive use of digital animation."

            "abstract": "Despite the Mozambique government's efforts to curb human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), national prevalence is 11.5% and support is needed to expand HIV related services and improve program quality. Positive prevention (PP) programs, which prioritize HIV prevention with people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV), have been recognized as an important intervention for preventing new HIV infections. To address this, an evidence based PP training intervention was implemented with HIV healthcare providers in Mozambique. This study focuses on the acceptability and feasibility of a PP intervention in HIV clinics from the healthcare provider perspective. In depth interviews were conducted with 31 healthcare providers from three provinces who participated in PP trainings in Mozambique. Interview data were coded using content analysis. Study data suggest that healthcare providers found PP acceptable, feasible to implement in their HIV work in clinic settings, and valued this strategy to improve HIV prevention. The PP training also led providers to feel more comfortable counseling their patients about prevention, with a more holistic approach that included HIV testing, treatment and encouraging PLHIV to live positively. While overall acceptance of the PP training was positive, several barriers to feasibility surfaced in the data. Patient level barriers included resistance to disclosing HIV status due to fear of stigma and discrimination, difficulty negotiating for condom use, difficulty engaging men in testing and treatment, and the effects of poverty on accessing care. Providers also identified work environment barriers including high patient load, time constraints, and frequent staff turnover. Recognizing PP as an important intervention, healthcare providers should be trained to provide comprehensive prevention, care and treatment for PLHIV. Further work is needed to explore the complex social dynamics and cultural challenges such as gender inequalities, stigma and discrimination which hinder the full impact of PP interventions in this context.\nMalgr� les efforts du gouvernement mozambicain dans la lutte contre le VIH/SIDA, le taux national de s�ropr�valence est de 11,5% et un soutien est indispensable pour d�velopper les services li�s au VIH et am�liorer la qualit� des programmes. Les programmes de Pr�vention Positive (PP) qui mettent l'accent sur la pr�vention du VIH aupr�s des Personnes Vivant avec le VIH et le SIDA (PVVIH) ont �t� reconnus comme une importante mesure dans la pr�vention de nouvelles infections au VIH. C'est dans ce but qu'une formation de pr�vention bas�e sur les preuves a �t� mise en oeuvre avec des fournisseurs de soins m�dicaux impliqu�s dans la lutte contre le VIH au Mozambique. Cette �tude porte sur la mani�re dont les fournisseurs de soins m�dicaux per�oivent l'acceptabilit� et la faisabilit� d'un programme de PP dans les cliniques traitant le VIH. Des entretiens en profondeur ont �t� men�s aupr�s de 31 fournisseurs de soins dans trois provinces qui ont particip� � des formations � la PP au Mozambique. Les donn�es de ces entretiens ont �t� cod�es selon la technique d'analyse de contenu. Elles sugg�rent que les fournisseurs de soins m�dicaux trouvent la PP acceptable et applicable dans leur travail sur le VIH en milieu clinique et accordent de l'importance � cette strat�gie visant � am�liorer la pr�vention du VIH. La formation � la PP a �galement permis aux fournisseurs de soins m�dicaux de conseiller plus ais�ment leurs patients sur les moyens de pr�vention gr�ce � une approche plus holistique comprenant le d�pistage du VIH, un traitement et encourageant les PVVIH � vivre de mani�re positive. Bien que la formation � la PP ait g�n�ralement �t� accept�e, plusieurs obstacles � sa mise en place sont apparus dans les donn�es. Parmi les obstacles li�s aux patients on trouve une r�sistance � divulguer la s�ropositivit� par peur de stigmatisation et discrimination, la difficult� � n�gocier l'utilisation du pr�servatif, la difficult� d'inciter les hommes � faire des examens et suivre un traitement m�dical, ainsi que la question de l'acc�s aux soins pour les plus d�munis. Ces fournisseurs de soins ont �galement identifi� les obstacles li�s � leur environnement de travail, notamment le nombre �lev� de patients, les contraintes de temps et le fr�quent roulement de personnel. Percevant la PP comme une mesure tr�s importante, ces fournisseurs consid�rent qu'ils devraient �tre form�s de mani�re � pouvoir offrir aux PVVIH des services complets dans les domaines de la pr�vention, des soins et traitements. D'autres �tudes sont � pr�sent n�cessaires pour explorer les dynamiques sociales complexes et les d�fis culturels tels que l'in�galit� entre les sexes, la stigmatisation et la discrimination, qui dans ce contexte limitent la port�e des interventions de la PP."

The sample for the study consisted of one hundred and fifty prison inmates who have been in prison custody for a period of at least eighteen months. The purposive sampling technique was adopted to obtain the sample for the study. A self-designed questionnaire namely Prisoners Knowledge of HIV/AIDS Questionnaire was used to obtain data from participants. Two research questions were raised to guide the study and one Null hypothesis was formulated and significantly tested at 0.05 level of significance. The research questions were answered using the mean responses while the Null hypothesis was analysed using a One- way Analysis of Variance. The result showed that the knowledge of participants' on the means of transmission of HIV/AIDS is low; secondly, the participants' knowledge on signs and symptoms of HIV/AIDS is also low. The result further indicated that there is no significant difference in the participants' knowledge of HIV/AIDS on the basis of educational qualification. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended that concerted efforts be made by all stakeholders to create and sustain HIV/AIDS awareness amongst prison inmates."

            "abstract": "Background:  Between 2009–2013 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation transitioned its HIV/AIDS prevention initiative in India from being a stand-alone program outside of government, to being fully government funded and implemented. We present an independent prospective evaluation of the transition. Methods:  The evaluation drew upon (1) a structured survey of transition readiness in a sample of 80 targeted HIV prevention programs prior to transition; (2) a structured survey assessing institutionalization of program features in a sample of 70 targeted intervention (TI) programs, one year post-transition; and (3) case studies of 15 TI programs. Findings:  Transition was conducted in 3 rounds. While the 2009 transition round was problematic, subsequent rounds were implemented more smoothly. In the 2011 and 2012 transition rounds, Avahan programs were well prepared for transition with the large majority of TI program staff trained for transition, high alignment with government clinical, financial and managerial norms, and strong government commitment to the program. One year post transition there were significant program changes, but these were largely perceived positively. Notable negative changes were: limited flexibility in program management, delays in funding, commodity stock outs, and community member perceptions of a narrowing in program focus. Service coverage outcomes were sustained at least six months post-transition. Interpretation:  The study suggests that significant investments in transition preparation contributed to a smooth transition and sustained service coverage. Notwithstanding, there were substantive program changes post-transition. Five key lessons for transition design and implementation are identified. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"
