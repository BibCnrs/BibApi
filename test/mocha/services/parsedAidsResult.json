Researches on children's perception of risk, knowledge and support services for infected persons have been rarely undertaken. This paper is based on responses obtained from 120 in-school children aged 9-13 years drawn from three schools in the Cape Coast Metropolis of Ghana. The respondents provided qualitative data through essays and quantitative data through questionnaires. All the respondents have had some knowledge on HIV and AIDS and knew of where to access HIV and AIDS information. More than seventy per cent of them were not willing to purchase fresh vegetables from AIDS vendors nor were willing to allow AIDS infected female teachers to continue teaching them. It was recommended that children should be targeted with behavioural change communication messages especially by teachers to enable them live harmoniously with people infected and affected with AIDS.\nAu Ghana, il a �t� estim� en 2013 que quelques 34 557 enfants vivaient avec le VIH et le SIDA.

Teachers were taught how to use children's literature to instruct and enhance their math curriculum through the use of literature pieces, manipulatives, and graphic organizers. For two weeks twelve fourth-grade students were taught long division using explicit teacher instruction without integrating children's literature, and at the end took an end of unit test on long division. Then, the students were taught long division using selected children's literature for two weeks and took the end of unit test again. Results indicate that using children's literature in math helps students understand and retain concepts more effectively. Selected quality children's literature can be effectively integrated in elementary math instruction to improve student math achievement."

[...]\nPurpose: This study examined the effects of consistent hearing aid (HA) use on outcomes in children with mild hearing loss (HL). Method: Five- or 7-year-old children with mild HL were separated into 3 groups on the basis of patterns of daily HA use. Using analyses of variance, we compared outcomes between groups on speech and language tests and a speech perception in noise task. Regression models were used to investigate the influence of cumulative auditory experience (audibility, early intervention, HA use) on outcomes. Results: Full-time HA users demonstrated significantly higher scores on vocabulary and grammar measures compared with nonusers. There were no significant differences between the 3 groups on articulation or speech perception measures. After controlling for the variance in age at confirmation of HL, level of audibility, and enrollment in early intervention, only amount of daily Ha use was a significant predictor of grammar and vocabulary. Conclusions: The current results provide evidence that children's language development benefits from consistent HA use. Nonusers are at risk in areas such as vocabulary and grammar compared with other children with mild HL who wear HAs regularly. Service providers should work collaboratively to encourage consistent HA use."

The teaching method adopted by a class teacher has a great effect on children interest, academic achievement and brain development of a child. To support this fact the researcher used two groups of children from ten schools to carry out a study. Five schools where used as control groups while another five schools was used as experimental groups. Both groups have a population of 400 pupils in the ten schools that were selected for the study. In carrying out this research, two research questions were raised to guide the study; with two hypotheses formulated and tested at 0.05 significant levels. Findings were discussed based on observations, and recommendations were made to guide the class teachers, parents, government and children on the importance of teaching aids in the teaching and learning of child development."

Despite their importance, the epidemic's potential consequences for family dynamics and children's psychological health are understudied. Using a population-based sample of 2,487 caregivers and 3,423 children aged 8--14 years from the Central Province of Kenya, analyses were conducted to examine whether parental illness and loss were associated with family functioning and children's externalizing behaviors. After controlling for demographics, a significant relationship between parental illness and externalizing behaviors was found among children of both genders. Orphan status was associated with behavioral problems among only girls. Regardless of gender, children experiencing both parental loss and illness fared the worst. Family functioning measured from the perspective of both caregivers and children also had an independent and important relationship with behavioral problems. Findings suggest that psychological and behavioral health needs may be elevated in households coping with serious illness and reiterate the importance of a family-centered approach for HIV-affected children."

OBJECTIVE: To describe the linguistic profile and the hearing skills of children using hearing aids, to characterize the rehabilitation process and to analyze its association with the children's degree of hearing loss. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sample of 110 children using hearing aids (6-10 years of age) for mild to profound hearing loss. Tests of language, speech perception, phonemic discrimination, and school performance were performed. The associations were verified by the following tests: chi-squared for linear trend and Kruskal-Wallis. RESULTS: About 65% of the children had altered vocabulary, whereas 89% and 94% had altered phonology and inferior school performance, respectively. The degree of hearing loss was associated with differences in the median age of diagnosis; the age at which the hearing aids were adapted and at which speech therapy was started; and the performance on auditory tests and the type of communication used. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of hearing loss and the clinical interventions occurred late, contributing to impairments in auditory and language development.\nINTRODUÇÃO: A deficiência auditiva pode comprometer o desenvolvimento infantil. O processo de reabilitação dos indivíduos com perda auditiva depende de intervenções eficientes. OBJETIVO: Descrever o perfil linguístico e as habilidades auditivas de usuários de Aparelho de Amplificação Sonora Individual (AASI), caracterizar o processo de intervenção fonoaudiológica e analisar sua relação com o grau da perda auditiva das crianças. MÉTODO: Estudo transversal com amostra não-probabilística composta por 110 crianças de 6 a 10 anos de idade, com perda auditiva de grau leve a profundo, usuárias de AASI. Foram realizados testes de linguagem, percepção de fala, discriminação fonêmica e desempenho escolar. As associações foram verificadas pelos testes x2 de tendência linear e Kruskal-Wallis. RESULTADOS: Cerca de 65% das crianças apresentavam alteração do vocabulário, 89% de fonologia e 94% tiveram desempenho escolar considerado inferior. O grau da perda auditiva mostrou-se associado a diferenças nas medianas das idades de diagnóstico, de adaptação do AASI e de início da fonoterapia; do tempo entre diagnóstico e adaptação do aparelho auditivo; ao resultado dos testes auditivos e ao tipo de comunicação utilizada. CONCLUSÃO: Independentemente do grau de perda auditiva, o diagnóstico e as intervenções necessárias ocorreram tardiamente, com prejuízo das habilidades linguísticas e auditivas destas crianças."

This study aimed to investigate nasality and nasalance in two groups of prelingually hearing impaired children, namely deaf children with a cochlear implant (CI) and moderate-to-severely hearing impaired hearing aid (HA) users. The results of both groups are compared with the results of normal hearing children. Besides, the impact of the degree of hearing loss was determined. Methodology: 36 CI children (mean age: 9;0y), 25 HA children (mean age: 9;1y) and 26 NH children (mean age: 9;3y) were assessed using objective assessment techniques and perceptual evaluations in order to investigate the nasal resonance of the three groups. Ten HA children had thresholds above 70dB (range: 91dB-105dB) and fifteen below 70dB (range: 58dB-68dB). The Nasometer was used for registration of the nasalance values and nasality was perceptually evaluated by two experienced speech therapists using a nominal rating scale (consensus evaluation)."

In the developing world, about 132 million people have lost one or both parents due to the AIDS pandemic and 25 million children have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS in 2010. The HIV prevalence in Cameroon is estimated at 5.1%. As of 2010, there were 304,000 deaths due to AIDS in Cameroon. Out of 1,200,000 orphans and vulnerable children in Cameroon in 2010, 300,000 were AIDS orphans. The HIV/AIDS burden impacts child survival, growth and development in the traditional African setting. With so many orphans in the population, along with many vulnerable children, strategies must be developed to respond more effectively to their critical needs. This study provides a model for OVC care and support in Cameroon. The model was developed out of extensive work using a participatory approach involving traditional, administrative and health stakeholders on OVC in Yaounde I and Yaounde VI Councils, Nanga Eboko Health District, Isangelle, Ekondo Titi, and Bafaka-Balue communities in Cameroon. Consultancy services with PLAN Cameroon, the Pan African Institute for Development-West Africa coupled with facilitation of many training workshops on OVC with Save the orphans Foundation, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Public Health and work- ing with the National AIDS Control Committee. The essential components of a holistic framework for the care of OVC have been identified. A public health model for the care of OVC and a mechanism for their identification and a referral system for testing OVC for HIV are proposed. Through this model, a mechanism for the effective holistic care of OVC and collaboration is enhanced."

The hypothesis is supported by a generalized method of moments (GMM) analysis of the relationship between health aid donors and child survival in 110 low- and middle-income countries during 1990-2010."

METHODS: Saliva samples from 50 children aged between 2 and 12 years treated by SUS (group I = control group, group II = group exposed to HIV without seroconversion, and group III = AIDS carriers) were collected, seeded in Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, and fungal cultures were grown at 35 ± 2° C for 24 hours. Three isolated colonies were randomly selected from each individual plaque for identification using the API20 AUX Biomerieux® method. RESULTS: The most frequent fungal species in samples from children not exposed to HIV, exposed to HIV, and AIDS carriers was Candida albicans (48.80%, 25.64%, and 58.13%, respectively). Species of Candida non-albicans were also isolated from all groups studied. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher prevalence of Candida albicans in these groups, non-albicans species represented a significant percentage of Candida isolates.\nOBJETIVO: Verificar a prevalência de leveduras do gênero Candida albicans e não-albicans isoladas de amostras bucais de crianças com AIDS, expostas ao HIV durante o período gestacional e não-expostas ao HIV atendidas pelo sistema único de saúde em um município do interior da Bahia- Brasil. MÉTODOS: Para a realização do estudo foram coletadas amostras de saliva de 50 crianças entre 2 e 12 anos atendidas pelo SUS (grupo I = controle; grupo II = expostas ao HIV, sem soroconversão e grupo III = portadoras da AIDS),que após semeadas em ágar Sabouraud dextrose com cloranfenicol, foram incubadas a 35°C±2/ 24h para verificação de crescimento de colônias. Dessas foram selecionadas aleatoriamente 3 cepas, de cada indivíduo, para identificação pelo método API 20 AUX da Biomerieux®. RESULTADOS: A espécie mais isolada nas amostras coletadas para os grupos de crianças não expostas ao HIV, expostas ao HIV e portadoras da AIDS foi a Candida albicans (48,8%; 25,64% e 58,13% respectivamente). Foram também isoladas espécies de Candida não-albicans em todos os grupos estudados. CONCLUSÕES: Observou-se que apesar de haver uma prevalência de espécies de Candida albicans isoladas, as espécies não-albicans perfizeram um percentual significativo dos isolados dessa espécie."

Existing studies have demonstrated a negative impact of caregiver's distress on children's well-being. Limited studies examined the potential pathways of the link. This study aims to examine whether parenting stress, parenting competence and parental responsiveness can explain the relationship between caregivers' distress and children's well-being. A community sample of children of parents living with HIV and their current caregivers (n = 754 dyads) was recruited in rural central China. Children completed the measures on their psychological well-being and perceived parental responsiveness of their caregivers. Caregivers reported on their psychological well-being, parenting stress, and parenting competence. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that caregivers' distress indirectly affect children's well-being through parenting stress, parenting competence and parental responsiveness. Parenting stress explained the impact of caregiver's distress on parental responsiveness and showed pervasive effects on parenting competence. Our findings lend credence to family-based intervention for children affected by HIV and affirm the importance of incorporating the cognitive, emotional and behavioral components of parenting practices in such intervention."

During this workshop, the benefits of administrating combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) to HIV positive women from pregnancy throughout breastfeeding were reviewed. cART is capable of reducing vertical transmission to less than 5% at 24 months of age, as well as maternal mortality and infant mortality in both HIV infected and exposed populations to levels similar to those of uninfected individuals. The challenge for programs targeting eMTCT in developing countries is retention in care and treatment adherence. Both are intrinsically related to the model of care. The drop-out from eMTCT programs before cART initiation ranges from 33%-88% while retention rates at 18-24 months are less than 50%. Comprehensive strategies including peer-to-peer education, social support and laboratory monitoring can reduce refusals to less than 5% and attain retention rates approaching 90%. Several components of the model of care for reduction of HIV-1 MTCT are feasible and implementable in scale-up strategies. A review of this model of care for HIV eMTCT is provided."

Poverty and HIV/AIDS-related stigma are additional risk factors for these negative mental health outcomes. Community level factors, such as poverty and stigma, are difficult to change in the short term and identifying additional potentially malleable mechanisms linking familial HIV/AIDS with mental health is important from an intervention perspective. HIV/AIDS-affected children are also at increased risk of bullying victimization. This longitudinal study aimed to determine whether prospective relationships between familial HIV/AIDS and both anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms operate indirectly via bullying victimization. Adolescents (M = 13.45 years, 56.67 % female, n = 3,515) from high HIV-prevalent (>30 %) communities in South Africa were interviewed and followed-up one year later (n = 3,401, 96.70 % retention). Census enumeration areas were randomly selected from urban and rural sites in two provinces, and door-to-door sampling included all households with a resident child/adolescent. Familial HIV/AIDS at baseline assessment was not directly associated with mental health outcomes 1 year later. However, significant indirect effects operating via bullying victimization were obtained for both anxiety and depression scores. Importantly, these effects were independent of poverty, HIV/AIDS-related stigma, and baseline mental health, which highlight bullying victimization as a potential target for future intervention efforts. The implementation and rigorous evaluation of bullying prevention programs in South African communities may improve mental health outcomes for HIV/AIDS-affected children and adolescents and this should be a focus of future research and intervention."

The recent influx of unaccompanied children into the United States exposed histories of victimization, vulnerability to CSA, and suggested an epidemic of CSA in Latin America. CSA has been identified as a contributory event to HIV infection. The aim of our research was to identify factors associated with CSA and Latin Americans. A systematic review and a document search were conducted on factors associated with CSA in Latin America. Victimization was associated with lifelong risk factors for HIV. Males were consistently underrepresented in the published CSA literature and machismo attitudes may contribute to abuses of sexual power by males and contribute to males not reporting or under-reporting victimization."

This study aimed to obtain insights into the perceptions of Sudanese pregnant women toward HIV/AIDS and the use of PMTCT services.\nMethods: Ten focus group discussions (FGDs) with women of reproductive age were conducted at community settings in Khartoum (N = 121). Recruitment eligibility included living near or around a PMTCT site and being in the age range of 18-40 years. Out of 121 women who participated, 72 (61 %) were pregnant. Predefined themes were addressed in the theory-based interview scheme, which was derived from multiple socio-cognitive theories-i.e., the Extended Parallel Process Model, the Reasoned Action Approach and the socio-psychological view on stigma. Emerging themes were incorporated during data analysis.\nResults: Few women knew about the Mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. No one indicated that MTCT might occur during labor. Most women believed that HIV/AIDS is a serious and fatal condition for them and also for their children. They believed they were susceptible to HIV/AIDS as a result of cesarean section, contaminated items (blood and sharp items) and husband infidelity. The usefulness and advantages of HIV testing were questioned; for some women it was perceived as an additional burden of anxiety and worry. Doctors were the most influential with regard to acceptance of HIV testing. The speed of the testing process and confidentiality were mentioned by some women as key factors affecting willingness to undergo HIV testing at a health facility during pregnancy.\nConclusion: The study reveals that most of the women felt susceptible to HIV infection with perceived high severity; however, this perception has not translated into positive attitudes toward the importance of HIV testing during pregnancy. Because of anticipated stigma, women are not likely to disclose their HIV status. Further research should focus on gaining a more in-depth understanding of the psycho-social determinants and processes underlying the factors identified above. In addition, the adequate implementation of Provider Initiated Testing and Counseling (PITC) should be critically assessed in future research about PMTCT in Sudan."
